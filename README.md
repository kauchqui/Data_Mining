# Data_Mining
C4.5 Algorithm implemented in python.

## Data Set

The dataset for this algorithm and the Naive Bayes algorithm found in my other repository can be found using [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom).
With ~10,000 training sets and ~1,000 test sets this algorithm performs at ~100% accuracy.

### Running the program
The program takes three command line arguments in this order: training_file, testing_file, output_file. The files must be in the same directory as the program file if you want to simply call them using only the filename, otherwise the full path will be required.
