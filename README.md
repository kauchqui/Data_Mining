# Data_Mining
C4.5 Algorithm implemented in python.
#Data Set
The dataset for this algorithm and the Naive Bayes algorithm found in my other repository can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom.
With ~10,000 training sets and ~1,000 test sets this algorithm performs at ~100% accuracy.
